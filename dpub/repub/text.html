			<h1>Long Live the Vortex</h1>
			<p>
				Long live the Vortex! Long live the great art vortex sprung up in the centre of this town!
			</p>
			<p>
				We stand for the Reality of the Present &mdash; not for the sentimental Future, or the
				sacripant Past.
			</p>
			<p>
				We want to leave Nature and Men alone.
			</p>
			<p>
				We do not want to make people wear Futurist Patches, or fuss men to take to
				pink and sky blue trousers.
			</p>
			<p>
				We are not their wives or tailors.
			</p>
			<p>
				The only way Humanity can help artists is to remain independent and work
				unconscious
			</p>
			<p>
				WE NEED THE UNCONSCIOUSNESS OF HUMANITY &mdash; their stupidity, animalism and dreams.
			</p>
			<p>
				We believe in no perfectibility except our own.
			</p>
			<p>
				Intrinsic beauty is in the Interpreter and Seer, not in the object or content.
			</p>
			<p>
				We do not want to change the appearance of the world, because we are net Naturalists,
				Impressionists OF Futurists (the latest form of Impressionism),
				and do not depend on the appearance of the world for our art.
			</p>
			<p>
				WE ONLY WANT THE WORLD TO LIVE, and to feel it's crude energy flowing through us.
			</p>
			<p>
				It may be said that great artists in England are always revolutionary, just as in France
				any really fine artist had a strong traditional vein.
			</p>
			<p>
				Blast sets out to be an avenue for all those vivid and violent ideas that could
				reach the Public in no other way.
			</p>
			<p>
				Blast will be popular, essentially. It will not appeal to any particular class,
				but to the fundamental and popular instincts in every class and description of people,
				TO THE INDIVIDUAL The moment a man feels or realizes himself as an
				artist, he ceases to belong to any milieu or time, Blast is created for this timeless
				fundamental Artist that exists in everybody.
			</p>
			<p>
				The Man in the Street and the Gentleman are equally ignored.
			</p>
			<p>
				Popular art does not mean the art of the poor people, as it is usually supposed to.
				It means the art of the individuals.
			</p>
			<p>
				Education (art education and general education) tends to destroy the creative
				instinct. Therefore it is in times when education has been non-existant that
				art chiefly flourished.
			</p>
			<p>
				But it is nothing to do with "the People."
			</p>
			<p>
				It is a mere accident that that is the most favourable time for the individual to
				appear.
			</p>
			<p>
				To make the rich of the community shed their education skin, to destroy politeness
				standardization and academic, that is civilized, vision, is the task we have
				set ourselves
			</p>
			<p>
				We want to make in England not a popular art, not a revival of lost folk art, or
				a romantic fostering of unactual conditions, but to make individuals, wherever
				found.
			</p>
			<p>
				We will convert the King if possible.
			</p>
			<p>
				A VORTICIST KING! WHY NOT?
			</p>
			<p>
				DO YOU THINK LLOYD GEORGE HAS THE VORTEX IN
				HIM?
			</p>
			<p>
				MAY WE HOPE FOR ART FROM LADY MOND?
			</p>
			<p>
				We are against the glorification of "the People", as we are against snobbery.
				It is not necessary to be an outcast bohemian, to be unkempt or poor, any more
				than it is necessary to be rich or handsome, to be an artist. Art is nothing to do with
				the coat you wear. A top-hat can well hold the Sixtine. A cheap cap could hide
				the image of Kephren.
			</p>
			<p>
				AUTOMOBILISM (Marinetteism) bores us. We don't want to go about
				making a hullo-bulloo about motor cars, anymore than about knives and forks,
				elephants or gas-pipes.
				HIM?
			</p>
			<p>
				Elephants are VERY BIG. Motor cars go quickly.
			</p>
			<p>
				Wilde gushed twenty years ago about the beauty of machinery. Gissing, in
				his romantic delight wlth modern lodging houses was futurist in this sense.
			</p>
			<p>
				The futurist is a sensational and sentimental mixture of the aesthete of 1890 and
				the realist of 1870.
			</p>
			<p>
				The "Poor" are detestable animals! They are only picturesque and amusing
				for the sentimentalist or the romantic! The "Rich" are bores without a single
				exception, en tant que riches!
			</p>
			<p>
				We want those simple and great people found everywhere.
			</p>
			<p>
				Blast presents an art of Individuals.
