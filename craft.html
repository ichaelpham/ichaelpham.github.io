         A recent history of craft: adoration and marginalisation
      </p>
      <p>
         Although the word ‘craft’ is derived from the old English cræft, meaning physical strength, over time it
         has come to describe the skillful making of things by hand. In the nineteenth century, when mechanisation
         became heavily criticised by the

         , craft found itself elevated as both a practice
         and a politicised idea. As the perceived antithesis of factory production and ‘unwholesome’ commerce, craft
         not only became a physical aspiration butalso a manifestation of taste and egalitarianism. As Crow (2008, 23)
         noted, ‘hands were celebrated as capable of probing the world, bringing a unity of working and learning.
         No machinery could replace the sensitivity of hands. Craft practice became synonymous with individualism and
         integrity.’ Thus, during this period, through the writing of

         became both theorised and associated with left-wing ideals. However, in

         This oscillation between the adored and the marginalised continued through the twentieth century, but
         slowly craft began a descent.

         engagement. With the increasing elevation of ‘concept’ over physical making, ‘factory’ artists like

         images they created). This may be seen distinctively in Poland during the 1950s and 1960s, when the crafts of
         painting, drawing and free hand writing were the substrate upon which the corpus of internationally respected

         Craft, pedagogy and creativity Reconsidering space
      </p>
      <p>
         Twenty years ago, graphic design education, close on the heels of the computer’s integration into the industry,
         began an ideological and pedagogical move from the drawing board to the keyboard. Classrooms increasingly featured
         rows or pods of computers and by the turn of the century students looked up from their workstations into the ubiquitous face of an LCD projection. Although carpeted and subdued, these learning environments had come to resemble a Dickensian classroom. People sat in front of workstations. They rarely talked in large groups and, despite the rhetoric of connectivity and choice, the spatial design was largely discrete. However, if we understand craft as both a thinking process (Crow 2008; Marzotto 2009; Peer 2011) and a community-oriented system of learning (Gamble 2001; Lave &amp; Wenger 1991), we might identify its potential contribution to creativity. Its effective environments are predicated on visual, tactile and oral discourse. Peer (2011, 1) notes: ‘To embrace a craft-based design practice is to embrace more than a setof materials or processes. Rather it involves an understanding of the discursive meanings inher- ent in craft.’ This discursiveness is a dialogue between the maker and the material, and a community of practice that surrounds them. Physical resources are shared, spaces and tools are contractually maintained and processes are physically studied and experimented with.

          its blend of tacit and explicit learning and its emphasis on physical observation, experimentation, acquisition and application remain intact. In the pursuit of creative thinking certain graphic designers seek environments where risk-taking and disobedient thought might operate to produce unique outcomes. Beyond the rituals of mastery traditionally associated with craft, handmade thinking can heighten potentials for ambiguity, serendipitous discovery and productive accidents in ways beyond those encountered on a computer. In this regard it is useful to consider three recent case studies of postgraduate designers who returned from industry to undertake theses in graphic design. All three researchers were accomplished in digital environments but all sought, for different reasons, to ideate and develop thinking through handmaking processes.

         In considering their stories we encounter a number of distinctive issues that arise when highly creative thinkers deliberately engage with the physicality of craft led thought.

         David Background
      </p>
      <p>
         David ran his own agency in London for twenty five years. Although he employed a number of designers and had considerable success, he entered postgraduate study to develop a body of work that could not be realised in a commercial environment. As a boy, he grew up in a tenement block in Kentish Town, North London. Raising children at a time when there was no government support for single parent families, his mother cleaned houses to pay the bills. As a young teenager David worked as a labourer to supplement the family income. These experiences of underpaid work shaped many of his political opinions. The thesis David’s award-winning thesis, Manifesto, was concerned with graphic re-tellings (as typographical prints) of workers’ narratives. The workers he interviewed had all been employed in paid work below the national minimum wage. He created fragments of their monologues as huge, floor-to-ceiling typographic statements. In doing this he sought to capture voices of exploited labour. Thought as labour David chose to explore the graphic potential of these interviews through the physicality of screenprinting.

      <p>
         In realising the projecthe sought empathetic processes through which he might experience the bodily nature of work in the process of designing. In his thesis he said, By extending the narration into physical work I hoped not only to‘exercise’ the visual potential of labour, but also to remind myself as a worker of the marks of effort, in exactness and fatigue… Through this process significant differences appeared between thumbnails generated on a computer and large, gritty prints created through a process of physical exertion.

               (Sinfield 2009, 47) When David engaged a design process that drew his physicality into both ideation and production he reached beyond the potentials of the digital realm.

          Scale, texture, weight, viscosity and porosity became part of a dynamic of experimentation and decision making. In crafting a solution in this malleable realm, the serendipitous marks of the maker became idiosyncratic elements in the design.
          <span class="foot_90">

          </span>
          David’s typographic prints integrated this ‘idiom of movement’ with design decision making. Thus, his designs were thought through a process of physical exertion. Craft was not just a practice, but also a process. Craft as a process Crow (2008, 25) suggests that craft as a process is the application of a ‘perceptive ability to generate surprises, combining motivation, visual thinking, knowledge of tools and our experience of media’.
      </p>
      <p>
         Broadly, craft can enable one to experiment with and refine thinking in environments composed of unstable relationships. Associations between a designer, materials and tools can be unpredictable. Materials dictate idiosyncratic responses and the unanticipated can occur when we use tools in unconventional ways. Although

         suggests that we pour ourselves into tools and ‘assimilate them as parts of our own existence [and] accept them existentially by dwelling in them’, tools can also disrupt intention. Thus, perceptively, Moholy-Nagy (1947, 36) noted that ‘Every tool, every medium, every process, whether it is technological or organic, has its intrinsic quality which, to understand and employ, must be listed among the main duties of a designer.’

         Productive instability
      </p>
      <p>
         Thinking through craft may take considerably longer and engender unique relationships between the designer and the manifestation of ideas. David said: Having come from a commercial background as a graphic designer, I have been trained in resolving given briefs… Dealing with no perceived outcome, and parameters that shifted the more deeply one experimented was very destabilising. Although I was told this would happen, it was a concept I didn’t initially understand. The project meant I had to re-evaluate the way I had been creatively thinking. (Sinfield 2009, 99)

      </p>
      <p>
         The unstable nature of creative environments is also the source of their richness. In 2007 the European University Association report on Creativity in Higher Education (European University Association 2007, 17) noted that creative thought ‘entails new developments… and requires a certain disrespect for established ideas and concepts as well as personal courage’. The realisation that courage might be part of the creative process featured again in the report’s description of problem solving ability. It noted (EUA 2007, 17) that creativity ‘requires thinking outside the box, looking at things from a new angle, venturing off the beaten path and risking failure’.
      </p>
      <p>
         Productive failure is a potential consequence of unstable relationships that exist between makers, materials and the processes they employ. But such failure requires understanding. Theses that seek to provoke disruption rarely run smoothly. There are no shortcuts. When designers embark on such creative journeys, supervisors need to discuss (early in the piece) the use of time buffers so scheduling does not become an unnecessary impediment to risk-taking and productive disruption. Thinking through craft does not offer opportunities for rapid solutions. It is not shorthand. Within its need for time and labour resides its potential for productive reflection and experimentation. Thus, when Ruskin (1857, 45) observed, ‘It is not the material but the absence of the human labor which makes the thing worthless’, he was not referring to physical exertion, but to the time for creative and critical delibera- tion that craft thinking affords.

      <p>
         Karol worked in publishing for thirty years before undertaking her master’s degree. In that time she had seen the arrival of the computer and also the demise of the typesetter, paste-up and the traditions of lead type printing. She was a distinctive designer.

         The thesis
      </p>
      <p>
         Karol’s thesis, The Passing (2011), contemplated debates over the death of the book. Considering anxieties over the demise of print, she crafted physical interpretations of the book as an obituary, eulogy, requiem and memorial. In designing these artifacts, she renominated the book’s materiality as a mode of metaphoric expression. Her eventual designs surfaced out of interfacing experiments in letterpress and bookbinding studios.

      <p>
         Discourse surrounding material technologies and their relationship with educational relevance has, in the past twenty years, been an on going debate. Odling-Smee (2002, 16) notes that in 1999 students at the London College of Printing revolted against the proposed disposal of their letterpress department, delivering a statement addressed to the head of its governing body which read ‘we understand the urge to incorporate digital media, but we don’t believe that computers can be a substitute for decades of human experience’.

      <p>
         At AUT University, the letterpress that Karol revived for her thesis had sat relatively unused. Its green dust cloth had faded and only a small number of students knew what it was. Although few among the staff wanted to throw it out, over the years its drawers of lead type, its chases and its associated equipment had been lost or frittered away into other projects. Karol believed that there might be a correla- tion between the corporeality of the technologies that made the book and how she might think about the book metaphorically. As a result, she considered the context of her thesis through manual processes of production. Somewhere within this she was seeking an authentic resonance between grief and hope.

         Thus, when we think through craft, we develop more than signs; the objects forming in our hands may instead be vectors or indicators of further thought.

         Lyna is a digital native. He left design school but, after a short time in the industry, returned to develop a body of work that demonstrated higher levels of signature. He said, as a professional designer, I wanted to explore approaches to research beyond those I have been able to realistically employ when working in a commercial environment… This was not an indulgence in Narcissism, but a potential opening up of an inquiry to the tacit and subjective, as a way of empowering and refining my personal signature.

         The design of his book referenced Victorian typography and embellishment, and revisited the sensuality and decadence that marked the closing years of the nineteenth century. The work emphasised moral binaries revealed in the story’s central characters.

         Perceptive integration

         Lyna worked between digital and malleable domains with oscillating grace. His initial ideation process occurred through sketching in notebooks.

               Stones &amp; Cassidy’s research (2010, 439) noted that ‘paper-based sketches, more than digital tools, can support the vital process of reinterpretation that generates new ideas’.
          </a>
         <sup>95</sup>
         </span>
         Thus, like Goel, they found that ‘reinterpretation that leads to the creation ofnew solutions is more supported in paper-based working’ (Goel 1995, 457). However, as Marzotto (2009, 72) notes, ‘handmade, craft-based and digital tools can coexist and interweave in flexible processes’.
      </p>
      <p>
         Although Lyna sketched and drew, he also integrated photographic elements into his work. He was interested in the fact that at the time of the publication of Wilde’s novel, the recently introduced medium of photography was caught in an ethical storm surrounding its claims to truth, art and authenticity. Lyna’s work was sketched, photocopied, collaged, painted over, scanned, digitally repainted and embedded with photographic records of models and distressed flora. When his orchestration of tools became a flexible system of multi-craft processes that collaboratively moved thinking forward, he engaged rich potentials for creative development. Although Marzotto (2009, 80) suggests, ‘the immediacy of software’s results can inhibit visual investigation&mdash;especially among students who  scarcely know any tool other than the pencil and the computer’, critical/creative interfaces between the digital and the handmade can also be creatively synergetic (Frayling 2011; Marzotto 2009; Crow 2008).

         Learning spaces
      </p>
      <p>
         Marzotto (2009, 76) notes that ‘Technologies have changed designer’s inventories, cleaning their studios of many little objects which could inspire the imagination.’ Indeed, many computer labs in design schools operate as hot desks where students visit as temporary migrants, log in for a few hours and then move on. The physical spaces they occupy are often sanitised and featureless. However, Lyna’s computer and his workshop occupied the same space. His walls were festooned with thinking drawings and he moved online and offline to engage with different types of community. Students like Lyna tend to infect space. They occupy and clutter it with the working processes of craft thinking. When they work, their thinking processes are physically more visible than those engaged with by students on a computer. Because of this exposure, supervisors and colleagues can watch and question their processes in significantly more accessible ways. In addition, the physical spaces they occupy promote the social imperatives of craft. These students work in each other’s company, often into the small hours of the morning. They build communities. They eat together, celebrate, commiserate, time-manage and offer critique on each other’s emerging designs. More than that, they often collaborate. In this physical world, practice is embodied and shared. Learning approaches a self-generating, community-enriched, educative process. This is supported by, but not dependent upon, the input of supervisors.

         These organisations, and many like them, all have as central to their construct combinations of craft and community. Design schools, if they take seriously the potentials of craft learning need to make strategic accommodations of both plant and space but, more importantly, they need to understand the unique nature ofcreativity, discovery and the role of craft in practice-led research. Thus, this article has raised two interrelated areas for consideration. First, craft may be understood as an embodied creative learning process, not a manufacturing skill. By engaging with tools and materials, designers can work in productively unstable environments where they may generate comparatively high levels of serendipitous, discovery-led learning. Here the unique marks of the maker become integral to what is designed. The designer engages in unique, empathetic dialogues with tools, materials, scale, time, instability and physicality. Second, craft enables social learning (which I would argue is integral to effective education). This reaches beyond digital networks. In contrast to the collective silo design of many digitally oriented environments, craft is predicated on principles of community. This means that spaces are shared and responsibility for the needs of other learners is forced into considera- tion as students pursue their own creative inquiries. The advantages of such learning spaces lie not only in the explicit exposure of thinking but also in the potential for community support, shared learning and concurrent critique. Craft is not an anachronism resurfacing as a nostalgic attempt to glorify the past. It is integral to both generative design and the creative processes thatfeed it. Its value is as much pedagogical as it is material. As design educators we are concerned with growing richly disobedient thinkers. We endeavour to reach beyond the constant and assured, to nurture designers rich in courage, sensory awareness and inquisitiveness. If creativity is associated with productive engagements with instability and discovery then we must think beyond preset functions. Within craft, lie hugely important potentials. We ignore them at our peril.
