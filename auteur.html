         ... As far as I know, there is no definition of the auteur theory in the English lan­guage, that is,
         by any American or British critic. Truffaut has recently gone to great pains to emphasise that the

         , and I am willing to take him at his word. But, lest I be accused of misappropriating a theory no one wants
         anymore, I will give the Cahiers critics full credit for the original formulation of an idea that reshaped my thinking
         on the cin­ema.

         First of all, how does the auteur theory differ from a straightforward theory of directors.

               Ian Cameron's article "Films, Directors, and Critics," in Movie of September, 1962
            </a>
            <sup>11</sup>
         </span>
         , makes an interesting comment on this issue: "The assumption that under­ lies all the writing in Movie is
         that the director is the author of a film, the person who gives it any distinctive quality. There are quite
         large exceptions, with which I shall deal later." So far, so good, at least for the auteur theory, which even
         allows for excep­tions. However, Cameron continues: "On the whole, we accept the cinema of direc­tors, although
         without going to the farthest-out extremes of the la politique des auteurs, which makes it difficult to think
         of a bad director making a good film and almost impossible to think of a good director making a bad one." We are
         back to Bazin again, although Cameron naturally uses different examples. That three other­ wise divergent
         critics like Bazin, Roud, and Cameron make essentially the same point about the auteur theory suggests a
         common fear of its abuses. I believe there is a mis­understanding here about what the auteur theory actually
         claims, particularly since the theory itself is so vague at the present time.

         First of all, the auteur theory, at least as l understand it and now intend to express it, claims neither
         the gift of prophecy nor the option of extracinematic perception. Directors, even auteurs, do not always run
         true to form, and the critic can never assume that a bad director will always make a bad film. No, not always,
         but almost always, and that is the point. What is a bad director, but a director who has made many bad films?

         What is the problem then? Simply this: The badness of a director is not necessarily considered the badness of a
         film. If Joseph Pevney directed Garbo, Cherkassov, Olivier, Belmondo, and Harriet Andersson in

         , the resulting spec­tacle might not be entirely devoid of merit with so many subsidiary auteurs to cover up for Joe.
         In fact, with this cast and this literary  property, a Lumet might be safer than a Welles. The realities of casting
         apply to directors as well as to actors, but the auteur theory  would demand  the gamble  with Welles, if he were willing.

         is more entertaining than many films with directors. A director­ conscious critic  would find it difficult
         to say anything good or bad about direction  that is nonexistent. One can talk here about photography, editing,
         acting, but not direction. The film even has  personality, but like

         , it is a cipher directorially.
         Obviously, the auteur theory cannot possibly cover every vagrant charm of the cinema. Nevertheless, the first
         premise of the auteur theory is the technical competence of a director as a criterion of value. A badly directed or
         an undi­rected film has no importance in a critical scale of values, but one can make interest­ing conversation about
         the subject, the script, the acting, the color, the photography, the editing, the music, the costumes, the decor,
         and so forth. That is the nature of the medium. You always get more for your money than mere art. Now, by the auteur
         the­ory, if a director has no technical competence, no elementary flair for the cinema, he is automatically cast out
         from the pantheon of directors. A great director has to be at least a good director. This is true in any art. What
         constitutes directorial talent is more difficult to define abstractly. There is less disagreement, however, on this
         first level of the auteur theory than there will be later.

      <p>
         The second premise of the auteur theory is the distinguishable personality of the director as a criterion of value.
         Over a group of films, a director must exhibit certain recurrent characteristics of style, which serve as his signature.
         The way a film looks and moves should have some relationship to the way a director thinks and feels. This is an area
         where American directors are generally superior to foreign directors. Because so much of the American cinema is
         commissioned, a director is forced to express his personality through the visual treatment of material rather
         than through the literary content of the material.

         The third and ultimate premise of the auteur theory is concerned with interior meaning, the ultimate
         glory of the cinema as an art. Interior meaning is extrapolated from the tension between a director's
         personality and his material. This conception of interior meaning comes close to what Astruc defines as
         mise en scene, but not quite. It is not quite the vision of the world a director projects nor quite his
         attitude toward life. It is ambiguous, in any literary sense, because part of it is imbedded in the stuff
         of the cinema and cannot be rendered in non cinematic terms.

               Truffaut has called it the temperature
               of the director on the set, and that is a close approximation of its pro­fessional aspect.

         Dare I come out and say what I think it to be is an elan of the soul? Lest I seem unduly mystical, let me hasten
         to add that all I mean by "soul" is that intangible difference between one personality and another,
         all other things  being equal. Sometimes, this difference is expressed by no more than a beat's hesitation
         in the rhythm of a film.

               In one sequence of La Règle du jeu, Renoir gallops up the stairs, turns to his right with a lurching movement,
               stops in hop like uncertainty when his name is called by a coquettish maid, and, then, with marvellous post
               reflex continuity, resumes his bearishly shambling journey to the heroine's boudoir.

         If I could describe the musical grace note of that momentary suspension, and I can't,
         one might be able to provide a more precise definition of the auteur theory. As it is, all I can do is point at
         the specific beauties of interior meaning on the screen and, later, catalogue the moments of recognition.

         The three premises of the auteur theory may be visualized as three concentric cir­cles: the outer circle as
        technique; the middle circle, personal style; and the inner cir­cle, interior meaning. The corresponding roles
        of the director may be designated as those of a technician, a stylist, and an auteur. There is no prescribed
        course by which a director passes through the three circles.

             Godard once remarked that Visconti had evolved from
             a metteur en scene to an auteur, where as Rossellini had evolved from an auteur to a metteur en scene.
           </a>
           <sup>24</sup>
        </span>
         From opposite directions, they emerged with com­parable status. Minnelli began and remained in the second circle
         as a stylist; Bufiuel was an auteur even before he had assembled the technique of the first circle. Technique is
         simply the ability to put a film together with some clarity and coherence. Nowadays, it is possible to become a
         director without knowing too much about the technical side, even the crucial functions of photography and editing.
         An expert pro­duction crew could probably cover up for a chimpanzee in the director's chair. How do you tell
         the genuine director from the chimpanzee? After a given number of films, a pattern is established.

         </p>
      <p>
         In fact, the auteur theory itself is a pattern theory in constant flux. I would never endorse a Ptolemaic
         constellation of directors in a fixed orbit. At the moment, my list of auteurs runs something like this through the
         first twenty: Ophuls, Renoir, Mizoguchi, Hitchcock, Chaplin, Ford, Welles, Dreyer, Rossellini, Murnau, Griffith,
         Sternberg, Eisenstein, von Stroheim, Bufiuel, Bresson, Hawks, Lang, Flaherty, Vigo. This list is somewhat weighted
         toward seniority and established reputations. In time, some of these auteurs will rise, some will fall, and some will
         be displaced either by new directors or rediscovered ancients. Again, the exact order is less important than the
         specific definitions of these and as many as two hundred other potential auteurs. I would hardly expect any other
         critic in the world fully to endorse this list, especially on faith. Only after thousands of films have been
         revaluated, will any personal pan­theon have a reasonably objective validity. The task of validating the auteur
         theory is an enormous one, and the end will never be in sight. Meanwhile, the auteur habit of collecting random
         films in directorial bundles will serve posterity with at least atten­tative classification.
      </p>
      <p>
         Although the auteur theory emphasizes the body of a director's work rather than isolated masterpieces,
         it is expected of great directors that they make great films every so often. The only possible exception
         to this rule I can think of is

         variations of the same film.

         -unwittingly reinforced the auteur theory by confirming the relative standing of the many directors involved.
         If I had not seen either film, I would have anticipated that the order of merit in Boccaccio '70 would be Visconti,
         Fellini, and De Sica, and in The Seven Capital Sins Godard, Chabrol, Demy, Vadim, De Broca, Molinaro. (Dhomme,
         Ionesco's stage director and an unknown quantity in advance:, turned out to be the worst of the lot.) There might
         be some argument about the relative badness of De Broca and Moli­naro, but, otherwise, the directors ran true
         to form by almost any objective criterion of value. However, the main point here is that even in these
         frothy, ultra commercial servings of entertainment, the contribution of each director had less in common
         sty­listically with the work of other directors on the project than with his own previous work.

         , one of the many maddeningly routine films Raoul Walsh has
         directed in his long career. This 1935 effort featured George Raft, Alice Faye, Frances Langford, and
         Patsy Kelly in one of those familiar plots about radio shows of the period. The film keeps moving along
         in the pleasantly unpre­tentious manner one would expect of Walsh until one incongruously intense scene
         with George Raft thrashing about in his sleep, revealing his inner feelings in mumbling dream-talk. The girl
         he loves comes into the room in the midst of his unconscious avowals of feeling and listens sympathetically.
