         Metahaven is a new kind of graphic design team. This self-styled 'design think tank' is such a departure
         from conventional forms of practice that it is unlikely many designers have heard of them yet, particularly
         outside the Netherlands. Nor do they go out of their way to provide colleagues with entry points into their
         concerns and methods.

         It would be easy to dismiss the team&mdash;graphic designers Daniel van der Velden and Vinca Kruk,
         and spatial designer Gon Zifroni&mdash;as arcane experimentalists whose activities have nothing to do with
         the realities of practice.

         This would be a mistake. Metahaven is one of the most theoretically informed, strategically adept and articulate
         groups of thinkers operating in graphic design. Their way of working is implicit in the authorship paradigm of the
         early 1990s, now out of fashion, but they take this to a new level of intellectual sophistication and conviction.
         Seen from the right angle, without commercial preconceptions, their critique of branding, identity and national
         borders is entirely coherent. In the five years since Van der Velden began the

         as a funded researcher at the Jan van Eyck Academie in Maastricht,
         where he was a student in the 1990s, they have initiated a fascinatingly diverse range of research projects,
         organised conferences, conducted interviews, published essays and taken part in exhibitions, collaborating with
         intellectuals and policy-makers located far from the usual territory of graphic design.

         Metahaven grew from a frustration with graphic design's well-worn paths. When Kruk graduated in 2003 from
         the Willem de Kooning Academie in Rotterdam, she faced essentially two choices: work for the larger, more
         corporate companies, or go into the cultural field, which in her view was already explored to the limit.
         'But there wasn't a space in graphic design where I felt there was a field for theory or something that you
         could develop without it being finished,' she says, in the Amsterdam studio she shares with Van der Velden
         (Zifroni, not present, works in Brussels).
      </p>
      <p>
         'There is an ultra-short incubation time that every piece of graphic design has to go through,' adds Van der
         Velden. At the end, the message is focused and anything deemed to be extraneous is eliminated. 'We need a space
         where we can work on things without there being this funnelling or bottleneck moment where that happens.'

         and beyond practice &mdash;a 'meta haven' (they later ran the words together). Van der Velden, then still working in
         partnership with Maureen Mooren on projects such as Archis magazine (see E3;eno. 45 vol. i2), appointed Kruk as a
         researcher on the Sealand project and they used the Ian van Eyck Academie's infrastructure to organise events and
         invite speakers.

         Kruk takes a slightly different view. 'I'm much more interested in developing design languages addressing different

         For about a year Metahaven's status was unclear, but by the start of 2006 they knew that they wanted to continue
         working together. In 2007, Van der Velden ended his working partnership with Mooren, and Metahaven became an enterprise
         primarily dedicated to research interests. Eighteen months on, he admits that the idea of a total break with commercial
         work was naive. 'There's no such thing as abstinence in design&mdash;that's given to monks and other purists,' he says.
         Today, the studio is kept afloat by teaching, workshops and lectures; grants for exhibition and publication projects

         between the NAi and the city of Rotterdam, sounds less satisfactory. 'You find out that their marketing department
         is absolutely not prepared to deal with a deeper discussion of what they are doing, or what the project might mean,'
         says Van der Velden. Offered a flexible identity that could look either luxurious (elitist) or cheap (socialist)
         as the occasion required, the NAi's marketing team was interested in only the elite component of the proposal.
         'At some point you want the thing you proposed or otherwise nothing, which is alarming. You become less willing to

         In October 2008, Metahaven were invited to Tallinn by the Estonian Design Center to join policy-makers,
         marketeers, advertising people and designers, to ponder the former Soviet republic's national brand.
         'The idea of an outside view is strongly idealised in [small] countries,' says Van der Velden. 'A brand
         cannot be produced by someone from Estonia. It has to be Wally Olins or Interbrand or one of these agencies
         which have this expertise. In that, you can see again this post-historical ideology that the only thing you can
         connect to is the West.'

         concerns with national borders and supranational identity into the street. Metahaven created a series often
         posters for the street furniture used to carry advertising and these were displayed along the ring road that
         encircles the city, forming a boundary between the centre and the outskirts. 'The ring is the demarcation line
         of a looming conflict,' they write. 'Its infrastructure is ready to be politicised.'

         Each image responds with graphic urgency to the idea of borders around and within Europe. In one poster,
         Metahaven transform the phrase 'L'Europe qui protege' (The Europe that protects), used as the slogan for
         France's European Union presidency, into a question: 'L'Europe qui protege de quoi?' (The Europe that protects

         Each MUPI (mobilier urbain pour l'information) has a more visible and more expensive 'A' side, used for commercial
         advertising, and a cheaper 'B' side, usually used for cultural posters, representing another kind of division, and
         Metahaven set out to gain access to some of the more favoured positions. 'In the centre of the city there are
         more expensive brands on the commercial side than on the commercial side in other areas,' says Kruk. 'So this
         system produces other borders in the city.' For Metahaven, it was important that their posters were allowed to intrude
         into some of these premium 'non-cultural' positions, a demand that required delicate negotiation between CAPC and
         Bordeaux city hall, and MUPI owners JCDecaux and Clear Channel Outdoor Advertising.

         The posters, each bordered by fierce diagonal slashes, like mutated warning signs, exemplify Metahaven's
         graphic approach. The designs are simultaneously raw and ambiguous, loud and enigmatic, deliberately unsettling.
         Their painterly qualities, accentuated by screenprinting, might make them look more like art than information design,
         especially in the context of a gallery project, but Van der Velden is adamant that they are not art. The posters
         break with the conventions of poster-making because they are not products of the system that normally generates
         street posters and because new kinds of information require new kinds of form. They are still design. 'If you
         say, "OK, now it has become art,"' he concludes, 'then it has also become useless for the discourse.'

         Van der Velden admits that in the early days of Metahaven, style was still a pressing concern for him&mdash;
         'it was much more about the role of exuberance, almost a longing for a new Gothic'&mdash;and 'Gothic', with its
         suggestion of intricate formal density and emotional power, is the right word. His essay

         is a loving analysis of the 'symmetrical maze of jagged forms' and the
         systematic illegibility seen in the overwrought logos of black metal bands. He has been a fan of metal, punk,
         grindcore, industrial and experimental music since his teens. As Van der Velden notes, Metahaven's sometimes
         discordant and difficult visual style attempts to strike its own balance between hammering and poetry: 'If you
         hammer too much it becomes too much like noise and if it becomes too poetic you lose the tension of the density of
         ideas.'

         In five years, Metahaven have progressed much further towards reconfiguring the design studio as think tank than
         any other graphic design team I can name. The precedents for this way of working are mostly architectural: the

         , based in the Design Interactions department at the Royal College of Art in London, advocate design as a form of
         speculative research presented as proposals, models and exhibitions. Metahaven's work likewise shows how graphic design
         can transcend its usual roles to become a medium of inquiry realised through visual form&mdash;they take care
         to stress the visual dimension of the outcome. They have teaching commitments at the Arnhem Academy of Art and
         Design (Kruk), and at Yale and the Sandberg Institute in Amsterdam (Van der Velden), and a more permanent
         academic base would serve their research goals. The inevitable danger, though, with the 'safe haven' provided by
         academia is that it can become a destination in itself.

         Asked what they are trying to accomplish through their projects in relation to the political sphere, they
         suggest that they see themselves not as exponents of a particular ideology but as reporters, attempting to
         filter and explain the time they live in. Although there is potentially a place for the designer as researcher
         / reporter, radical political awareness implies position-taking and, beyond that, some form of action-otherwise
         what is it for? Certainly, the consistently political nature of their research and writing presupposes an audience
         actively concerned, as they are, with issues of policy and ideology, and how they are represented in visual form.
         If this new kind of graphic-related research is to focus on matters of wider public concern, then its audience
         should be the public. It will be interesting to see how Metahaven deal with the political logic and strategic
         implications of their analysis as their think tank develops.
